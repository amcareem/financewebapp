# financewebapp
This is a web app created with the help of Flask, databases which you can get the info of Stocks

I have used mainly the python language
This is a simple web app which works as a stock exchange.(Like in a stock market where you can see and buy stock market shares and all)

I have obtained the stock market API from IEX to get the details on stock (https://cloud-sse.iexapis.com/stable/stock/nflx/quote?token=API_KEY)

In this you can register, quote for a stock, buy and also sell.
You may also add a password.

This is a simple project which I made to polish my programming skills
